##############################
# 1. Run ggplot(data = mpg). What do you see?

# 2. How many rows are in mpg? How many columns?

# 3. What does the drv variable describe? Read help for ?mpg to find out.

# 4. Make a scatterplot of hwy versus cyl. 

# 5. What happens if you make a scatterplot of class versus drv? Why is this plot not useful?
