## Exercise 2 - matrices ##
###########################
# 1. Create the matrix X, from the example above and assign it to the variable X

# 1.2 Check your result with is.matrix() function, which should return TRUE.

# 2. Find the transpose of X and assign it to the variable Y. 

# 3. What do X an Y look like?

# 4. Can you multiply X by itself? 
# Hint: by the laws of linear algebra you shouldn't be able to!

# 4.1 What happens if you run the code: X * X? And X %*% X? What is the difference?

# 4.2 Can you multiply X by Y (remember Y = t(X))? Why is this matrix special?

# 4.3 Can you multiply Y by X? Is the matrix different from 2.2?

# 5. Just like with vectors, we can access and subset the elements of a matrix with []. Can you access the element on the 3rd row and 2nd column of X? 
# Remember matrices are two-dimensional!

# 1. Try to use the length() function with X. What does this give you? Hint: how do the results compare when you used it with vec1?
